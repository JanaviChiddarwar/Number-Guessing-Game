# Number-Guessing-Game
This project is a simple and fun Number Guessing Game developed in Java. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game gives feedback indicating whether the guess is too low or too high, helping the player reach the correct answer.
